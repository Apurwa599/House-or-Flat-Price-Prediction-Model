## House-or-Flat-Price-Prediction-Model
### Overview
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict house or flat prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property-related attributes. The project was developed as part of my Data Science / Machine Learning learning and internship work.Accurate price prediction helps buyers, sellers, and real estate companies make informed decisions.

### Objectives
* Analyze real estate data
* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
* Build a machine learning model for price prediction
* Evaluate model performance
* Predict house/flat prices for new inputs

### Technologies & Tools Used

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas & NumPy** – Data analysis
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning algorithms

### Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Handle missing values and outliers
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Encode categorical variables
5. Split data into training and testing sets
6. Train machine learning model
7. Evaluate model performance
8. Make predictions

### 📊 Machine Learning Approach
* **Algorithm Used**: Linear Regression (or other regression models)
* **Evaluation Metrics**:
  * R² Score
  * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
